The program was written entirely from scratch, but it fully replicates all the features and design of HyperCam 2. Unlike the original, this program is only available for Linux and BSD systems. Audio recording is also not currently supported, but this will be fixed soon. The program is designed not only for ease of use but also to evoke a nostalgic experience.

# How to install the program?

You can compile the program yourself on your PC. Just enter the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/MrYobaColla/hypercam2-for-linux`

`cd hypercam2-for-linux`

`chmod 777 build.sh`

`./build.sh`
